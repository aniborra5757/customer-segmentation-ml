# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project segments mall customers into distinct groups based on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, using unsupervised machine learning (K-Means). It includes an interactive **Streamlit web app** for live predictions, visualizations, and downloads.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Perform customer segmentation using K-Means
- Visualize cluster formation using Elbow and Scatter plots
- Evaluate cluster quality using Silhouette Score
- Build an interactive web app to upload, cluster, and download customer data

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle - Mall Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)  
**Columns:**
- `CustomerID`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

**Used for clustering:**
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## 🚀 Setup & Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/customer-segmentation-ml.git
cd customer-segmentation-ml
````

### 2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training (Optional)

Run this if you want to retrain the model manually:

```bash
python src/customer_segmentation.py
```

✅ Outputs:

* `models/kmeans_model.pkl`
* `models/scaler.pkl`
* `elbow_plot.png`
* `cluster_plot.png`
* Silhouette Score in terminal

---

## 🌐 Streamlit App (Main Feature)

Launch the web app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### 🔧 App Features

* 📂 Upload CSV with `Annual Income` and `Spending Score`
* 📄 View raw data and clustered data
* 🎯 Visualize customer segments (scatter plot)
* 📈 View dataset summary
* 📷 See pairplot of selected features
* ⬇️ Download CSV with assigned clusters

## 🔐 `.gitignore` (Recommended)

To prevent `venv/`, cache files, and large data from being pushed:

```
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pkl
*.csv
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

You can deploy this app to **Streamlit Cloud**:

1. Go to [https://streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Click "New app"
3. Select your GitHub repo: `customer-segmentation-ml`
4. Set main file as: `app.py`
5. Click **Deploy**

Done! Your app is now publicly available.

---

## 📦 Future Improvements

* Allow user to select number of clusters (K)
* Apply PCA for 3D visualization
* Add gender/age for multi-feature clustering
* Build dashboard using Plotly or Dash
* Deploy as Flask/FastAPI API for integration
